# Work In Progress!
## Introduction
Are you sick of having to scroll through a slow-loading ad-infested website and a 300+ word life story when you just want to see ingredients and instructions for a recipe you've used before?! Look no further! Log your recipes on this app and never have to go through that horrid experience ever again!

```

Using Yarn:

## Things to add

- Create a `.env` file in the config directory and add the following as `key: value` :
  - PORT: `2121` (Can be any port! Example: 3000) 
  - DB_STRING: `your MongoDB database URI`
