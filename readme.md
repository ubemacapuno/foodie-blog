# FoodieBlog
## Introduction
Are you sick of having to scroll through a slow-loading ad-infested website and a 300+ word life story when you just want to see ingredients and instructions for a recipe you've used before?! Look no further! Log your recipes on this app and never have to go through that horrid experience ever again!

## Objectives

- The objective of this project is to develop a full-stack CRUD application for something I'm passionate about while incorporating CRUD, MVC architecture, authentication, and Tailwind CSS. And that passion being able to easily look up ingredients while at the grocery store, and logging my recipes!!

---

## Who is this for? 

- This is for people that HATE ad-infested websites that force you to scroll through someone's life story just to look up how to make guacamole!! And of course for developers learning to make full-stack applications using Node, MongoDB, and JS templating (EJS). 

---

## Packages/Dependencies used 

bcrypt, connect-mongo, dotenv, ejs, express, express-flash, express-session, mongodb, mongoose, morgan, passport, passport-local, validator, nodemon, tailwindcss, postcss, and postcss-cli.
